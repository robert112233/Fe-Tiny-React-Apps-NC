Changes left to Implement:

1. Should work with words with repeated letters Ie. "Elate" (currently breaks the colour coding)
2. Should provide negative feedback if no letters match
3. Should consult a dictionary Api before allowing a user to enter a word
4. Should grey out letters on the Keypad if they don't match the word
